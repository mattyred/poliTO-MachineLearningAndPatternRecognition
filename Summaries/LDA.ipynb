    "The goal of the LDA technique is to project the original data matrix onto a lower dimensional space. To achieve this goal, three steps needed to be performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The first step is to calculate the separability between different classes, which is called the between-class variance or between-class matrix. \n",
    "2) The second step is to calculate the distance between the mean and the samples of each class, which is called the within-class variance or within-class matrix.\n",
    "3) The third step is to construct the lower dimensional space which maximizes the between-class variance and minimizes the within class variance"
